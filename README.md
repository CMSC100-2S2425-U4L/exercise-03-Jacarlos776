    This program contains three functions: 
    validPassword(string1, string2) - This function takes two strings as input and returns true if the strings are equal, 
    is greater than 8 characters, has one uppercase, lowercase, and numeric character. Otherwise, it returns false.

    reversePassword(string) - This function takes a string as input and returns the string in reverse order.

    storePassword(name, password1, password2) - This function takes a name and two strings as input and returns an object 
    with the name and newPassword key-value pairs. If the password is valid, the newPassword is the reverse of password1. 
    Otherwise, the newPassword is password1.
